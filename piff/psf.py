        r"""Draws an image of the PSF at a given location.

        The normal usage would be to specify (chipnum, x, y), in which case Piff will use the
        stored wcs information for that chip to interpolate to the given position and draw
        an image of the PSF:

            >>> image = psf.draw(chipnum=4, x=103.3, y=592.0, stamp_size=48)

        However, if the PSF interpolation used extra properties for the interpolation
        (cf. psf.interp_property_names), you need to provide them as additional kwargs.

            >>> print(psf.interp_property_names)
            ('u','v','ri_color')
            >>> image = psf.draw(chipnum=4, x=103.3, y=592.0, ri_color=0.23, stamp_size=48)

        Normally, the image is constructed automatically based on stamp_size, in which case
        the WCS will be taken to be the local Jacobian at this location on the original image.
        However, if you provide your own image using the :image: argument, then whatever WCS
        is present in that image will be respected.  E.g. if you want an image of the PSF in
        sky coordinates rather than image coordinates, you can provide an image with just a
        pixel scale for the WCS.

        When drawing the PSF, there are a few options regarding how the profile will be
        centered on the image.

        1. The default behavior (``center==None``) is to draw the profile centered at the same
           (x,y) as you requested for the location of the PSF in the original image coordinates.
           The returned image will not (normally) be as large as the full image -- it will just be
           a postage stamp centered roughly around (x,y).  The image.bounds give the bounding box
           of this stamp, and within this, the PSF will be centered at position (x,y).
        2. If you want to center the profile at some other arbitrary position, you may provide
           a ``center`` parameter, which should be a tuple (xc,yc) giving the location at which
           you want the PSF to be centered.  The bounding box will still be around the nominal
           (x,y) position, so this should only be used for small adjustments to the (x,y) value
           if you want it centered at a slightly different location.
        3. If you provide your own image with the ``image`` parameter, then you may set the
           ``center`` to any location in this box (or technically off it -- it doesn't check that
           the center is actually inside the bounding box).  This may be useful if you want to draw
           on an image with origin at (0,0) or (1,1) and just put the PSF at the location you want.
        4. If you want the PSf centered exactly in the center of the image, then you can use
           ``center=True``.  This will work for either an automatically built image or one
           that you provide.
        5. With any of the above options you may additionally supply an ``offset`` parameter, which

        profile using ``prof.drawImage(..., method=method)``.  This may be either 'no_pixel'
        or 'auto' depending on whether the PSF model already includes the pixel response or not.
        Some underlying models includ the pixel response, and some don't, so this difference needs
        to be accounted for properly when drawing.  This method is also appropriate if you first
        convolve the PSF by some other (e.g. galaxy) profile and then draw that.
