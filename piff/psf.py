        a YAML file, although for compound PSF types, it may be the field for just one of
        several components.

        This function merely creates a "blank" PSF object.  It does not actually do any

        The normal usage would be to specify (chipnum, x, y), in which case Piff will use the
        stored wcs information for that chip to interpolate to the given position and draw
        an image of the PSF:

            >>> image = psf.draw(chipnum=4, x=103.3, y=592.0, stamp_size=48)

        (cf. psf.extra_interp_properties), you need to provide them as additional kwargs.

        Normally, the image is constructed automatically based on stamp_size, in which case
        the WCS will be taken to be the local Jacobian at this location on the original image.
        However, if you provide your own image using the :image: argument, then whatever WCS
        is present in that image will be respected.  E.g. if you want an image of the PSF in
        sky coordinates rather than image coordinates, you can provide an image with just a
        pixel scale for the WCS.
