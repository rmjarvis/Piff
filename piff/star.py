class Star(object):
    """Information about a "star", which may be either a real star or an interpolated star
    at some target location.

    The Star object is the fundamental way that Piff keeps track of information connected to
    a particular observation location.  This includes both the input data (postage stamp image,
    position on the detector, position in the field of view, weight image, etc.) and derived
    information connected to whatever Model is being used


    Stars are not normally constructed directly by the user.  They are built by various
    Piff functions such as:

        stars = input_handler.makeStars(logger)
        stars, wcs = piff.Input.process(config['input'])
        target_star = piff.Star.makeTarget(x=x, y=y, wcs=wcs, ...)

    However, a star can be constructed directly from a StarData instance and a StarFit instance.
    The former keeps track of the data about the star (either as observed or the model at a
    location) and the latter keeps track of fitted parameters related to fitting the data to
    a model.

        star = piff.Star(star_data, star_fit)

    Stars have an immutable design, so any functions that change either the data or the fitted
    parameters return a new object and  don't change the original.  e.g.

        star = psf.drawStar(star)
        star = star.reflux()
        star = star.addPoisson(gain=gain)

    Stars have the following attributes:

        star.data       The component StarData object
        star.fit        The component StarFit object

    and the following read-only properties:

        star.image      The image of the star
        star.weight     The weight map connected to the image data
        star.image_pos  The position of the star in image coordinates, aka (x,y)
        star.field_pos  The position of the star in field coordinates, aka (u,v)
        star.x          The x position of the star in image coordinates
        star.y          The y position of the star in image coordinates
        star.u          The u position of the star in field coordinates
        star.v          The v position of the star in field coordinates
        star.chipnum    The chip number where this star was observed (or would be observed)
        star.flux       The flux of the object
        star.center     The nominal center of the object (not necessarily the centroid)
        star.is_reserve Whether the star is reserved from being used to fit the PSF
        star.hsm        HSM measurements for this star as a tuple: (flux, cenu, cenv, sigma, g1, g2)

    **Class intended to be immutable once returned from the method that creates it.**

    This includes:
      - a postage stamp of the imaging data
      - the weight map for these pixels (zero weight means the pixel is masked or otherwise bad)
      - whether the pixel values represent flux or surface brightness
      - the pixel area on the sky
      - the position of the star on the image
      - the position of the star in the full field-of-view (local tangent plane projection)
      - possibly extra information, such as colors

    A StarData object can render the pixel data in one of two ways:

      - getImage() returns the pixels as a galsim.Image.
      - getDataVector() returns the pixels as a numpy array.

    Different use cases may prefer the data in one of these forms or the other.

    A StarData object also has this property:
      :property pixel_area:    Solid angle on sky subtended by each pixel,
                               in units of the uv system.

    The other information is stored in a dict.  This dict will include at least the following
    items:

      - x
      - y
      - u
      - v

    And anything else you want to store.  e.g.

      - chipnum
      - ra
      - dec
      - color_ri
      - color_iz
      - gain

    Any of these values may be used for interpolation.  The most typical choices would be either
    (x,y) or (u,v).  The choice of what values to use is made by the interpolator.  All such
    values should be either int or float values.
