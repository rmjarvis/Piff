# Sphinx documentation is in gh-pages directory on my Mac.
# It's really another repo, not part of this one, so don't include it in this repo.
# cf. http://raxcloud.blogspot.com/2013/02/documenting-python-code-using-sphinx.html
# for instructions about how to set this up.  (Although now that it's been set up once,
# just do `git checkout gh-pages` in that directory, not --orphan.)
