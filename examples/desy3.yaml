# This sample config file is based on the config file that was used for the
# Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 analysis and included in the DES Y3 paper,
# Jarvis, et al, 2020 (Appendix B).

# The main change from that configuration file is that this one uses the
# SingleChip psf type, which produces a single output file for a whole exposure,
# rather than a separate one for each CCD.

# However, there is only a single CCD image included in the repo, so as given,
# the output file will only have the solution for a single CCD.  If desired,
# you may get the full list of exposures and input catalogs via
#
#   wget https://www.sas.upenn.edu/~mjarvis/desy3.tar.gz --no-check-certificate
#   tar xfz desy3.tar.gz
#
# After unpacking the tarball, the 350139 directory will have all the exposures,
# not just chip 12.
#
# Also, this configuration requilres the pixmappy Python package, which can be
# installed via either of:
#
#   conda install pixmappy
#   pip install pixmappy
#
# However, if you don't want to use that, you can remove (or comment out) the
# modules and input.wcs fields, in which case, the code will use the (less
# accurate) WCS that ships with the image in the fits file.
#
# It also originally used Piff version 1.0.  We have made minor updates to this
# file to keep it current with the latest Piff version, so it can serve as a
# more useful template for people looking for an example Piff configuration.

    # Note: This isn't technically a selection, but it is also handled by the selction code,
    # so it goes in this field of the configuration file.  This item doesn't change which
    # objects are selected; it just downweights the brightest stars so they don't dominate

psf:

    # For the DES Y3 solutions, we actually did type: Simple, which is almost the
    # same, but makes a separate file for each CCD.
    #
    # Note that when using SingleChip type, you will need to specify the chipnum
    # when using functions like psf.draw, even if there is only one chip in the input files.
    # (Since in general, one uses this type when there are multiple chips being processed.)
    # Therefore, if you haven't downloaded the full set of 60 ccds to use, then you'll need
    # to call `psf.draw(..., chipnum=12)`.
